            <h1>Problem</h1>
            <p>Unfettered access to rapid and safe COVID-19 tests is one of the most critical factors in reducing the spread of the disease. There is a need for a simple collection method that promotes social distancing, reduces the load and pressure on the diagnostic centers and vastly increases the daily testing capacity of the diagnostic centers.</p>
